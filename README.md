Project Overview
Project Name: Spacegem (Gemstone Classifier)

# Space Gem ðŸš€
**Space Gem** is a computer vision gemstone classification app that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the YOLO model to predict and identify various types of gemstones from images. It offers a user-friendly interface to upload gemstone images and get them recognized in real-time.

## Project Overview

Space Gem uses a **YOLO model** to identify and count gemstones in an uploaded image. When only one gemstone is recognized, a **CNN model** is used for classification. The YOLO model recognizes five types of gemstones, while the CNN model supports 87 gemstone classifications. The app provides a detailed prediction along with a description of the gemstone through OpenAPI integration.

- **Frontend**: Developed with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.
- **Backend**: Uses **CNN** and **YOLO** for prediction.
- **Training Data**:
    Sourced from Kaggle data set: `[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/gemstones-images)`, Roboflow data set: `[Link](https://universe.roboflow.com/val-hphzo/gemstones-2e1jx/dataset/6)`


## API Usage
The Space Gem API is built using FastAPI and can be accessed by sending an image via a POST request.

### Endpoint
- **URL:** http://localhost:8000/upload/**
- **Method:** POST

### Form Data
image: Image file to be uploaded.

***Response Example***
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "Ruby"
      "A ruby is a variety of corundum and is considered one of the four precious stones."
    },
  ]
}
```

### How to Call the API
You can test the API by uploading an image through the Streamlit frontend, which sends requests to the backend for prediction.

## Model Details
### YOLO Model:
- Recognizes 5 types of gemstones.
- Uses the YOLO architecture for object detection.

### CNN Model:
- Classifies 87 types of gemstones.
- Based on a convolutional neural network, fine-tuned for gemstone classification.

## Frontend Usage
1. Upload an Image: Visit the frontend interface built with Streamlit. Upload an image containing gemstones.

2. Prediction: The API processes the image and returns predictions, showing details about the gemstone type and description.

The user does not need to log in to use the service.
