Project Overview
Project Name: Spacegem (Space Gemstone Classifier)

# Space Gem ðŸš€
**Space Gem** is a machine learning-powered gemstone classification app that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the YOLO model to predict and identify various types of gemstones from images. It offers a user-friendly interface to upload gemstone images, analyze them, and get gemstone predictions in real-time.

## Project Overview

Space Gem uses a **YOLO model** to identify and count gemstones in an uploaded image. When only one gemstone is recognized, a **CNN model** is used for classification. The YOLO model recognizes five types of gemstones, while the CNN model supports 87 gemstone classifications. The app provides a detailed prediction along with a description of the gemstone through OpenAPI integration.

- **Frontend**: Developed with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.
- **Backend**: Uses **FastAPI** and **YOLO** for prediction.
- **Training Data**: Sourced from Kaggle (link will be updated).

## Installation Instructions

To set up the Space Gem app on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Streamlit** for frontend deployment
- **FastAPI** for backend API

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spacegem.git
   cd spacegem

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

3. Run the backend FastAPI app:
 ``` bash
 uvicorn api.fast:app --reload
  ```

4. Start the frontend using Streamlit:
``` bash
streamlit run space_gem/app.py
```

### API Usage
The Space Gem API is built using FastAPI and can be accessed by sending an image via a POST request.

### Endpoint
- **URL:** http://localhost:8000/upload/**
- **Method:** POST

### Form Data
image: Image file to be uploaded.

***Response Example***
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "Ruby"
      "A ruby is a variety of corundum and is considered one of the four precious stones."
    },
  ]
}
```

### How to Call the API
You can test the API by uploading an image through the Streamlit frontend, which sends requests to the backend for prediction.

## Model Details
### YOLO Model:
- Recognizes 5 types of gemstones.
- Uses the YOLO architecture for object detection.

### CNN Model:
- Classifies 87 types of gemstones.
- Based on a convolutional neural network, fine-tuned for gemstone classification.
-Both models were trained using data sourced from Kaggle. (Kaggle dataset URL).

## Frontend Usage
1. Upload an Image: Visit the frontend interface built with Streamlit. Upload an image containing gemstones.

2. Prediction: The API processes the image and returns predictions, showing details about the gemstone type and description.

The user does not need to log in to use the service.

## Data Security
***Image Storage:***
Images uploaded by users are processed in memory and not stored on the server to ensure privacy.

***Security Considerations:***
- The API is protected using FastAPIâ€™s built-in validation to prevent misuse.
- The application does not store any personal data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
